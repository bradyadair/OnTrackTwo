<div class="content">
    <a href="http://www.cottagesofhope.org">Cottages of Hope</a>, a non-profit located in Ogden Utah, exists to help
    households achieve greater levels of financial self-sufficiency.

    One of the key elements of financial stability is having adequate earned income to support the household. Having
    enough income to

    pay bills, enjoy living, and to save for a future emergency is the basis for what we consider a “Livable Wage”. This
    calculator was

    created to provide a quick and easy way to determine the “Livable Wage” needed for a household to become
    self-sufficient.

        We would like to thank our amazing community partners who made this calculator possible:
    </b>

    <br>
    <br>

    First, we want to recognize the amazing work of the Department of Economics at Weber State University, led by Dr.
    <a href="http://www.weber.edu/goddard/jennifergnagey.html">Jennifer Gnagey Ph.D.</a>, who
    performed a comprehensive study in 2016 of what a family living in Ogden needs to earn to live without government or
    private assistance. The <a href="http://www.cottagesofhope.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Ogden-Independent-Living-Standard-Official.pdf">“Ogden
    Independent Living Standard”</a> looked at the key components of a household budget that would be covered by a Livable
    Wage. Significant contributions
    were also made by Daniel Brinkerhoff, B.S. in Business Economics and Michael Rodgers, B.S. in Quantitative
    Economics. Our calculator is based on the
    results of this study.

    <br>
    <br>

    Secondly, we want to recognize the efforts of the Computer Science Department at Weber State University, where a
    group of students created this online
    calculator as their capstone project. Students contributing to the online tool include Tanner Griffin, Ashton
    Morris, Bryce Palmer, and Adam Salvo who
    worked under the direction of their instructor, <a href="http://www.weber.edu/CS/Peterson_Brad.html">Bradley Peterson</a>. There efforts to design a simple interface that
    draws from and interacts with a very
    complicated series of tables and formulas shows their ingenuity and expertise.
